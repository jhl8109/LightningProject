## Lightning Project

It means completing the project in a short time.

It's the final exam period soon.

Before that, I want to experience App Project. Especially, Connecting the app and the server.

I've never made App myself using Android Studio(Java), Nodejs.

I don't think it'll be of good quality, but it's fun!

### Project name :  Schedule Alarm

### Programming Language I use : Android Studio, Nodejs , Mysql

### Content 

#### Scenario before making it

It'll take 2 days.
It's only for experience. 
So I'm going to make it simple.

### Implementation

* Simple schedule list with CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
* Use Nodejs Web Server for storing data (not using sqlite)

### Review

It wasn't as easy as I thought.
I think I have to implement more data-safe codes.
Specifically, Exception handling, boolean type in json and store boolean to tinyint in mysql.

This is my first lightning project. It is so helpful to apply for any programming concepts with experience.
