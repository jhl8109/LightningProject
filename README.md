## Lightning Project

It means completing the project in a short time.

It's the final exam period soon.

Before that, I want to experience App Project. Especially, Connecting the app and the server.

I've never made App myself using Android Studio(Java), Nodejs.

I don't think it'll be of good quality, but it's fun!

### Project name :  Schedule Alarm

### Programming Language I use : Android Studio, Nodejs , Mysql

### Content 

#### Scenario before making it

It'll take 2 days.
It's only for experience. 
So I'm going to make it simple.

### Implementation

* Simple schedule list with CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
* Use Nodejs Web Server for storing data (not using sqlite)
